## CastingRecall - v1 - Back End

Casting ReCall is a movie based guessing game in which the player attempts to geuss the titles of six movies baed on the cast list.
This API server genrates the key to each puzzle by querying The Movie Database using the following sequence:

1. Chose a random year between 1990 and now.
2. Get one of the most popular movies from that year.
3. Load five actors from that movie.
4. Randomly choose an actor from the previously loaded.
5. Choose one of that actors most popular movies, excluding any duplicates.
6. Load five more actors from that movie, excluding any dupicates.
7. Repeat until the total number of movies is 6.
